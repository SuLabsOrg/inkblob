Walrus is a platform for building efficient and resilient data markets, where data is stored as blobs. Walrus stores each blob as an immutable array of bytes, and you can store any type of file, such as text, video, or source code.

Sui is a blockchain that supports programmability at a fundamental level. Walrus binds all blobs to objects on the Sui blockchain.

Walrus and Sui
Walrus depends on Sui, as it leverages Sui to track blobs, their respective owners, and their lifetimes.

Sui and Walrus are both decentralized, distributed systems made up of many independent servers that communicate and collectively establish shared state. A group of servers together is a network.

Available networks
Sui and Walrus each have the following available networks:

Testnet is a sandbox-like network where you can receive test tokens for free to use for the network's fees. You can build, test, and debug software packages on Testnet. Testnet does not guarantee data persistence and might wipe data at any time without warning.
Mainnet is a production environment where you use real tokens and users or other applications rely on consistent functionality.
When you are getting started, you should use Testnet.

Install tooling
To install Walrus and Sui, use the Mysten Labs suiup tool. First, install suiup:

curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mystenlabs/suiup/main/install.sh | sh
Then, install sui and walrus:

suiup install sui
suiup install walrus
Configure tooling for Walrus Testnet
After installing Walrus it is important to configure the Walrus client, which tells it the RPC URLs to use to access Testnet or Mainnet, as well as the Sui objects that track the state of the Walrus network. The easiest way to configure Walrus is to download the following pre-filled configuration file.

curl --create-dirs https://docs.wal.app/setup/client_config.yaml -o ~/.config/walrus/client_config.yaml
Next, you need to configure the Sui client to connect to Testnet. The Sui client configuration is separate from the Walrus client configuration. Learn more about the Sui client configuration.

Initialize the Sui client:

sui client
When prompted, enter the following:

Connect to a Sui Full Node server? → Y
Full node server URL → https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
Environment alias → testnet
Select key scheme → 0 (for ed25519)
This creates your Sui client configuration file with a Testnet environment and generates your first address.

To confirm the Walrus configuration also uses Testnet, run the command:

walrus info
Make sure that this command's output includes Epoch duration: 1day to indicate connection to Testnet.

For detailed information about the walrus command-line tool, use the walrus --help command. Or, append --help to any walrus subcommand to get details about that specific command.

Understanding your Sui account
When you ran sui client during setup, the system automatically created a Sui account for you. Sui uses addresses and accounts. When you store blobs on Walrus, Walrus binds them to an object on Sui that an address owns.

An address is a unique location on the blockchain. A 32-byte identifier (displayed as 64 hex characters with 0x prefix) identifies the address, which can own objects. The system derives the address from a public key using a hash function.

Anyone can see addresses, and they are valid on all networks (Testnet, Mainnet, and so on), but networks do not share data and assets.

An account is an address plus the key to access it. If you have an address's private key, you have privileged access and control over what the address owns, such as tokens and objects.

To view your active address, run:

sui client active-address
To see all your addresses and their key schemes, run:

sui client addresses
Warning: Store your keys securely

You must store your private key and recovery passphrase securely, otherwise you might lose access to your address.

Learn more about addresses, available key pair options, and key storage.

Creating additional addresses (Optional)
You can create additional addresses if needed:

sui client new-address ed25519
The argument ed25519 specifies the key pair scheme to be of type ed25519.

Fund Sui account with tokens
Before you can upload a file to Walrus and store it as a blob, you need SUI tokens to pay transaction fees and WAL tokens to pay for storage on the network. The Walrus Testnet uses Testnet WAL tokens that have no value and you can exchange them at a 1:1 rate for Testnet SUI tokens.

To get SUI tokens, navigate to the SUI Testnet faucet:

https://faucet.sui.io/

Ensure you select Testnet. Then, insert your Sui address. To print your Sui address, use the command:

sui client active-address
After you insert your address on the faucet and receive a message saying you have received SUI tokens, check your balance with the command:

sui client balance
Tip: Faucet alternatives

The Sui faucet is rate limited. If you encounter errors or have questions, you can request tokens from the Discord faucet or a third party faucet. Learn more about the Sui faucet.

Now, convert some of those SUI tokens into WAL with the command:

walrus get-wal --context testnet
Then, check your balance again with sui client balance to confirm you now have WAL:

╭─────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Balance of coins owned by this address  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ╭─────────────────────────────────────╮ │
│ │ coin  balance (raw)     balance     │ │
│ ├─────────────────────────────────────┤ │
│ │ Sui        497664604      0.49 SUI   │ │
│ │ WAL Token  500000000      0.50 WAL   │ │
│ ╰─────────────────────────────────────╯ │
╰─────────────────────────────────────────╯
Store a blob
Changes to objects on Sui happen through the use of transactions. Accounts sign these transactions on behalf of addresses and they result in the system creating, updating, transferring, and sometimes destroying objects. Learn more about transactions.

To upload a file to Walrus and store it as a blob, run the following command:

walrus store file.txt --epochs 2 --context testnet
Replace file.txt with the file you want to store on Walrus. You can store any file type on Walrus.

You must specify the --epochs flag, as the system stores blobs for a certain number of epochs. An epoch is a certain period of time on the network. On Testnet, epochs are 1 day, and on Mainnet epochs are 2 weeks. You can extend the number of epochs the system stores a blob indefinitely.

The system uploads a blob in slivers, which are small pieces of the file the system stores on different servers through erasure coding. Learn more about the Walrus architecture and how the system implements erasure coding.

After you upload a blob to Walrus, it has 2 identifiers:

Blob ID: oehkoh0352bRGNPjuwcy0nye3OLKT649K62imdNAlXg
Sui object ID: 0x1c086e216c4d35bf4c1ea493aea701260ffa5b0070622b17271e4495a030fe83
Blob ID: A way to reference the blob on Walrus. The system generates the blob ID based on the blob's contents, meaning any file you upload to the network twice results in the same blob ID.
Sui Object ID: The blob's corresponding newly created Sui object identifier, as the system binds all blobs to one or more Sui objects.
You use blob IDs to read blob data, while you use Sui object IDs to make modifications to the blob's metadata, such as its storage duration. You might also use them to read blob data.

You can use the Walrus Explorer to view more information about a blob ID.

Retrieve a blob
To retrieve a blob and save it on your local machine, run the following command:

walrus read <blob-id> --out file.txt --context testnet
Replace <blob-id> with the blob's identifier the walrus store command returns in its output, and replace file.txt with the name and file extension for storing the file locally.

Extend a blob's storage duration
To extend a blob's storage duration, you must reference the Sui object ID and indicate how many epochs you want to extend the blob's storage for.

Run the following command to extend a blob's storage duration by 3 epochs. You must use the Sui object ID, not the blob ID:

walrus extend --blob-obj-id <blob-object-id> --epochs-extended 3 --context testnet
Replace <blob-object-id> with the blob's Sui object ID the walrus store command returns in its output.

Delete a blob
All blobs stored in Walrus are public and discoverable by anyone The delete command does not delete blobs from caches, slivers from past storage nodes, or copies that could have been made by users before the blob was deleted.

To delete a blob, run the following command:

walrus delete --blob-id <blob-id> --context testnet
Replace <blob-id> with the blob's identifier the walrus store command returns in its output.
